# Hackintosh|10900k-Z490I
This repository is about my personal journey when creating my first Hackintosh build on my gaming machine. The machine is dual booting macOS Monterey 12.4 & Windows 11.
First off, I'd like to thank the awesome Hackintosh community and the creators/devs for the loads of help with this project.
